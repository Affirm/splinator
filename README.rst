.. code-block:: python

    from splinator.estimators import LinearSplineLogisticRegression
    import numpy as np

    # random synthetic dataset
    n_samples = 100
    rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    X = rng.normal(loc=100, size=(n_samples, 2))
    y = np.random.randint(2, size=n_samples)

    lslr = LinearSplineLogisticRegression(n_knots=10)
    lslr.fit(X, y)
