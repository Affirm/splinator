LSLR vs Isontonic Regression vs Sigmoid Calibration
===============


This is `model comparison notebook <https://github.com/Affirm/splinator/blob/main/examples/calibrator_model_comparison.ipynb>`__
that compares LSLR (Linear Spline Logistic Regression) against different calibration algorithms offered by sklearn. The
notebook is modified from scikit-learn `Calibration section <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html>`__
